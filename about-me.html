                <p class="about-me-text">Benjamin Brumby was born in Atlanta, GA in April of 1985, but has spent most of
                    his life living in Orlando. He graduated from Dr. Phillips High School in 2003 before attending the
                    University of North Carolina School of the Arts. He graduated with a BFA in Technical Theater in
                    2007. After college, Ben moved first to northern Massachussetts, and then to Baltimore, MD. Ben took
                    a position for 4-1/2 years working for a company that installed corporate Christmas displays all
                    across the country, including one at the world's largest indoor shopping mall in Dubai.</p>

            <p class="about-me-text">After that job ended, Ben moved back to his hometown of Orlando, and took a job
                working for a company that planned and managed corporate events and trade shows. For more than 6 years,
                Ben worked doing technical drawings in AutoCAD for some of the largest events and tradeshows in the
                Southeast United States, ranging in size and scope from International Association of Amusement Park
                Attractions Convention to the NFL Drafts in 2018 and 2019. When that business dried out due to COVID-19,
                Ben decided it was time to try someting new and different, and has embraced coding as a new career. <br>
                Ben lives in Dr. Phillips with his wife, Mandy, their two sons, William and Nathan, and their dog, April.</p>
