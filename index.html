                <p class="about-me-text"><strong>After that job ended, Ben moved back to his hometown of Orlando, and
                        took a job
                        working for a company that planned and managed corporate events and trade shows. For more than 6
                        years,
                        Ben worked doing technical drawings in AutoCAD for some of the largest events and tradeshows in
                        the
                        Southeast United States, ranging in size and scope from International Association of Amusement
                        Park
                        Attractions Convention to the NFL Drafts in 2018 and 2019. When that business dried out due to
                        COVID-19,
                        Ben decided it was time to try someting new and different, and has embraced coding as a new
                        career.
